# Contributing to Did You Used to Live Here?

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This project is deliberately simple:  
make displacement visible, preserve memory, and invite others to bear witness.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Submit a location:**  
  If you know of a site that used to house people and has since been erased, share before/after photos, Street View links, or personal accounts.  
  → Send to **info@didyouusedtolivehere.org**.

- **Improve the site:**  
  Spot a typo? Want to tweak the design? Have a better way to embed stories? Fork the repo and submit a Pull Request.

- **Add a story:**  
  You can add a new HTML page (or Markdown file) for a location, following the existing structure. Keep it factual, but don’t strip away the humanity.

## Guidelines

1. **Keep it respectful.**  
   This project is about honoring displaced people, not sensationalizing them.

2. **Truth first.**  
   Use evidence when possible (Street View, photos, news). If it’s a personal memory, clearly state it as such.

3. **No erasure of erasure.**  
   Don’t remove someone’s contribution unless it’s inaccurate or harmful. If you disagree, start a conversation in Issues.

And if you think the project should be done differently?  
That’s the beauty of open source: fork it, remix it, make it better.  
We just want the record to exist.
