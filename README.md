# Did You Used to Live Here?

**One question. A thousand erased homes.**

In 2022, this spot was a tent city.  
In 2025, it became “luxury apartments.”  
None of the people who lived there could come back.

This project is a living record of displacement.  
It documents places where people once lived, and what those spaces were replaced with.
